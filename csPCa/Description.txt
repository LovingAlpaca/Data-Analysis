According to the four diagnostic strategies
MRI, SB, MRI-TB, and TB combined with SB, respectively
Random forest and linear classification were built and generated methods and model reports for each respectively
Random forest was selected as the deployment model through comparison
Deployed to debian server through flask, html source is bootstrap and modified

Model Training csPCa.ipynb 
for the whole process of machine learning

App.py 
is responsible for the server back-end flask framework

Model.py 
for the introduction of machine learning models (.joblib) to build the class library

all.joblib
These are the model files trained with random forest 
and dataset (1-s2.0-S2352340922008885-mmc1.xls) based on the four diagnostic strategies
